writing in a diary. Semantic memory (MEMORY.md) is updated automatically at
session end and is never written by the queen directly.

    Use this when something significant just happened: a pipeline went live, the

    you want to record something that should be remembered across sessions.

    Write in first person, as you would in a private diary. Be specific — what
    happened, how the user responded, what it means going forward. One or two
    paragraphs is enough.

    You do not need to include a timestamp or date heading; those are added
